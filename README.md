# Overview of the Project
The famous tenzies game made with React.

## Challenges
* The project contains 12 dice and a roll button. When you click the roll button random numbers from 1-6 appear on each die. You have to roll the dice till all dice consist of the same value. 

  I have added a count feature to the game so it tells you how many turns it took to win the game. Also added a confetti package when the game ends.
